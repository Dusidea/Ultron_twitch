# Ultron_Twitch

## About

Ultron_twitch is meant to help streamers monitor their "competition" on a given category over a given period of time.
Twitch displays how many channels are live at insant T on a specific category but does not provide history.
The Ultron should request via Twitch API the list of channels on a given category (with their viewers count, stream title, channel name, language) every five minutes. The app extracts and stores data.

### Project phases

-   Phase 1 : simple file storage
-   Phase 2 : task automation
-   Phase 3 : storing in database
-   Phase 4 : producing charts

### Consider:

-   how to admin the list of categories?
-   how to request several categories (when one game = different categories)

## My dev notes

### Phase 1

#### Creating a custom command

```
php bin/console twitch:collect-viewers
```

=> File created : src/Command/TwitchCollectCommand.php

#### Environment variables

a env.local file is needed at the project's root

```
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=[your Twitch client_id]
TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN=[your token]
```

how to get credentials: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth/#client-credentials-grant-flow

/!\ Security: all .env files should be in gitIgnore to prevent KEY and secret exposure
in .gitingore add _.env_

#### Timezone

Timezone is set in bin > console

#### response sort

(Helix API â€“ Get Streams) :
"Streams are sorted by viewer count in descending order by default."

by default there's a pagination after 25 results => explicitly request 100 res: " /helix/streams route returns 25 results max by request, except if you mention "first=100".

### Phase 2 Automation

#### Task manager

Win + R, type taskschd.msc to open de task planner
Rigth panel => create a new task
trigger => every hour, repeat every 5 min
Action => start a program - program : path to php.exe - arguments : path to project/bin/console + space + command (twitch:collect-viewers) - start in : path to project

Notes : with this method, the task will execute only if my own computer is on
Next step: migrate to a Linux server (VPS) and use Cron instead

### Phase 3 Handling serveral games/categories

1st : extracted business logic in \src\Service\TwitchCollector.php (and kept the inital TwitchCollectCommand.php as entry point)
It required adapting the config\services.yaml file to handle autowiring issues
2nd in services.yaml I also added the category list and I call it in the TwitchCollector.php
Now launching the command writes in separate files (1 per game, gathering alternative categories for the same game). We now create specific folders (1 per game)

Next => installing on a VPS and using Cron as real automation.

// I put all .env files in git ignore but project can't work without a .env (values can be clear) and .env.local (values are sensitive), maybe .env could be committed

### Phase 4 Frontend

#### Serving the files (endpoints)

src > controller > FileController.php
allows to get a list of files on the route /files (http://[VPS_IP]:8000/files)
still need to allow file dl

#### Creating a web server (nginx)

-   Install Nginx
-   configure a virtual host pointing towards public/ in symfony
-   configure PHP-FPM
